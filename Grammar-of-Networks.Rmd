# Introduction

This is an RMarkdown file to introduce the `Network Graph` set of Metaphors, using `R` code. We will connect various `concepts/ideas` and their `graph-metaphors`.

The method followed will be based on PRIMM:

-   **PREDICT** what the code does, **write predictions**

-   **REUSE** the code provided and check what happens

-   **INFER** what the `parameters` of the code do and **write comments to explain**

-   **MODIFY** the `parameters` code provided to understand the `options` available. **Write comments** to show what you have aimed for and achieved.

-   **MAKE** : take an idea/concept of your own, and graph it.

    Write a short reflection at the end of the kind of metaphors you found in this work.

# Graph Metaphors

Network graphs are characterized by two key terms: **nodes** and **edges**

1.  `Nodes` : **Entities** (Individual Actors? People? Things? Ideas?) to be connected in the network. Synonyms: `vertices`. Nodes have `IDs`.

2.  `Node list`: a data frame with a single column listing the node IDs found in the edge list. You can also add **attribute columns** to the data frame such as the names of the nodes or grouping variables. ( Type? Class? Family? Country? Subject? )

    | ID  | Node Name  | Attribute? Qualities? Categories? Family? Planet? |
    |:---:|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
    |  1  | Ned        | Nursery School Teacher                            |
    |  2  | Jaguar Paw | Apocalypto                                        |
    |  3  | John Snow  | Epidemiologist                                    |

    : Table 1: Nodes List

3.  `Edges`: **Connections** (Interactions? Relationships? Influence? Dependence?) between the entities. Synonyms: `links`, `ties`.

4.  `Edge list`: data frame containing two columns: **source node** and **destination node** of an `edge`. Source and Destination have `node IDs`.

5.  `Weighted network graph`: An edge list can also contain additional columns describing attributes of the edges such as a magnitude aspect for an edge. If the edges have a magnitude attribute the graph is considered weighted.

    +--------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
    | From ID (=Source)        | To ID (=Destination)    | Weight? Attribute? Qualities? Categories? |
    |                          |                         |                                           |
    | ( From Node ID column!!) | (From Node ID column!!) |                                           |
    +==========================+=========================+===========================================+
    | 1                        | 4                       | 3.5                                       |
    +--------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
    | 2                        | 3                       | Financial Dealings                        |
    +--------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
    | 4                        | 8                       | Has a crush...                            |
    +--------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

    : Table 2: Edges List

6.  `Layout`: A **geometric** arrangement of `nodes` and `edges`.

    Metaphors: Location? Spacing? Distance? Coordinates? Colour? Shape? Size? Provides visual insight due to the `arrangement`.

7.  `Layout Algorithms` : `Method` to arranges `nodes` and `edges` with the aim of optimizing some `metric` .

    Metaphors: Nodes are `masses` and edges are `springs`. The Layout algorithm minimizes the stretching and compressing of all springs. (BTW, are the Spring Constants K the same for all springs?...)

8.  `Directed and undirected network graph`:

-   If the distinction between source and target is meaningful, the network is **directed.** If the distinction is not meaningful, the network is **undirected**. **Directed edges** represent an ordering of nodes, like a relationship extending from one nodes to another, where switching the direction would change the structure of the network. **Undirected edges** are simply links between nodes where order does not matter.

    Examples:

    -   The World Wide Web is an example of a directed network because hyperlinks connect one Web page to another, but not necessarily the other way around (Tyner, Briatte, and Hofmann 2017).

    -   Co-authorship networks represent examples of un-directed networks, where nodes are authors and they are connected by an edge if they have written a publication together (Tyner, Briatte, and Hofmann 2017).

    -   When people send e-mail to each other, the distinction between the sender (source) and the recipient (target) is clearly meaningful, therefore the network is directed.

9.  `Connected` and `Disconnected` graphs

-   If there is *some* path from any node to any other node =\> Connected.
-   Else Disconnected

## Using `tidygraph` and `ggraph`

`tidygraph` and `ggraph` are modern R packages for network data. Graph Data setup and manipulation is done in tidygraph and graph visualization with ggraph.

-   `tidygraph` Data -\> "Network Object" in R.

-   `ggraph` Network Object -\> Plots using a chosen layout/algo.

Both leverage the power of **`igraph`**, which is the **Big Daddy** of all network packages.

### Using the Star Wars dataset

#### 1.Read the data

```{r 1.Read_star_wars}
starwars_nodes <- read_csv("./Data/star-wars-network-nodes.csv")
#

starwars_edges <- read_csv("./Data/star-wars-network-edges.csv")
#


starwars_nodes
starwars_edges
#
```

#### 2.Create a network object using tidygraph:

Key function: `tbl_graph()`. (aka "tibble graph")

key arguments: `nodes`, `edges` and `directed`

```{r 2.Create_graph_object}
g <- tbl_graph(nodes = starwars_nodes, edges = starwars_edges, directed = TRUE)
g
#






```

#### 3. Plot using `ggraph`

Key functions:

-   `ggraph(layout = "......")`: Create classic node-edge diagrams; i.e. Sets up the graph. Rather like `ggplot` for networks!

-   `geom_node_point(aes(.....))`: Draws node as "points".Alternatives exist! Remember the `geom`s that we have seen before!

-   `geom_edge_link(aes(.....))`: Draws edges as "links". Alternatives exist!

-   `geom_node_text(aes(label = ......), repel = TRUE)`: Adds text labels (non-overlapping).

-   `labs(title = "....", subtitle = "....", caption = "....")`: Change main titles, axis labels and legend titles. We know this from our work with `ggplot`.

```{r 3a.Plot_starwars_using_ggraph}
autograph(g)
#




```

Describe this graph, in simple words here.

```{r 3b.Plot_starwars_using_ggraph}

# A more flexible,tweakable way
p <- ggraph(graph = g,  layout = "kk") + 
#
 
  geom_edge_link(width = 2, color = "pink") + 
  #
 
  geom_node_point(shape = 21, size = 8, fill = "blue", color = "green", stroke = 2) +
  #

  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), colour = "yellow") +
  #

  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! My first silly Star Wars graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Why did Ramesh put me in this course...",
       caption = "Bro, they are doing cool things in the other classes...")

p
```

Let us **Play** with this graph and see if we can use some small changes. Colour? Fill? Width? Size? Stroke? Labs? Of course!

```{r 3b.Play_with_starwars_using_ggraph}

# A more flexible,tweakable way
p <- ggraph(graph = g,  layout = "kk") + 
#
 
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight)) + 
  #
 
  geom_node_point(shape = 21, size = 8, fill = "blue", color = "green", stroke = 2) +
  #

  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), colour = "yellow") +
  #

  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! My next silly Star Wars graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Why did Ramesh put me in this course...",
       caption = "Bro, they are doing cool things in the other classes...")

p
```

Now we are ready ( maybe ?) change the meaning and significance of the entire graph and each element within it, such as the **aesthetics / mappings** to achieve new meanings or insights.

The elements we can tweak are:

Node Parameters:

    -   `alpha` (opacity; a value between 0 and 1)
    -   `colour` (colour of shapes 0-20 and border colour for 21-25)
    -   `fill` (fill colour for shape 21-25)
    -   `shape` (node shape; a value between 0 and 25)
    -   `size` (size of node)
    -   `stroke` (size of node border)

Edge Parameters:

    -   `edge_colour` (colour of the edge, a fixed colour)
    -   `edge_width` (width of the edge, a fixed number) or 
    -   `aes(width = some_variable)` + `scale_edge_width(range = c(min_value, max_value))`
    -   `edge_linetype` (linetype of the edge, defaults to "solid")
    -   `edge_alpha` (opacity; a value between 0 and 1)
    -   `label` (an edge label too!!)

```{r Modify}
# Numbered Code lines below: leave these commented
# these are for reference
# Uncommenting: Select all below + Shift/Ctrl/C

ggraph(graph = g,layout = "fr") +


  # 1.geom_edge_link(width = 2, color = "pink") +
geom_edge_arc(aes(width = weight)) +


  # 2.geom_node_point(shape = 21, size = 8, fill = "blue", color = "green", stroke = 2) +
  geom_node_point(shape = 21, size = 8,fill = "blue", color = "green", stroke = 2) +

  # 3.geom_node_text(aes(label = id), colour = "yellow") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = id), colour = "yellow") +

  labs(title = "Whoo Hoo! My first silly Star Wars graph in R!",
       subtitle = "Why did Ramesh put me in this course...",
       caption = "Bro, they are doing cool things in the other classes...")
```

grey_nodes <- read_csv("./Data/greys-nodes.csv")
grey_edges <- read_csv("./Data/greys-edges.csv")
head(grey_nodes)
head(grey_edges)
ga <- tbl_graph(nodes = grey_nodes, edges = grey_edges)
autograph(ga)

  geom_edge_link0(edge_width = 0.5, colour = "grey66") + 
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = sex), size = 3,shape = 21)+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("F"="#EA3456", "M"="#98EFAB", "NA" = "black")) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), size = 1 + 0.5*degree(ga), 
                 #family = "serif", 
                 repel = TRUE) +
  scale_size(range = c(0.2, 3)) +
  theme_graph() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

# Make-1

0.  Fire up a *new* RMarkdown. Write your name, file_name and date.
1.  Take any of the following datasets:

-   Airline Data:

    -   Start with this bit of code in your second chunk, after `set up`

        `airline_nodes <-read_csv("./Data/GephiWorkshop-AIRLINES-NODES.csv") ) %>% mutate(Id = Id + 1)`

        `airline_edges <- read_csv("./Data/GephiWorkshop-AIRLINES-EDGES.csv") %>% mutate(Source = Source + 1, Target = Target + 1)`

-   The Famous Zachary Karate Club dataset

    -   Try `?karate` in the console

    -   `data("karate",package= "igraphdata")`

    -   Note that this is **not** a set of nodes, nor edges, **but** already a **graph-object**! You will need to just go ahead and plot using `ggraph`. No need to create a graph object using `tbl_graph`.

-   Game of Thrones:

    -   `GoT <- read_rds("/Data/GoT/GoT.RDS")`
    -   Note that this is a **list** of **7** graphs from Game of Thrones. Select one using `GoT[[index]]` where index = 1...7 and then plot directly.

-   Any other graph dataset from `igraphdata` (type `?igraphdata` in console)

2.  Inspect the data.
3.  Create graph objects.
4.  Write comments in the code

# Make-2

This is in groups. The same groups that you have been working in.

0.  Fire up a *new* RMarkdown. Write in your names, file_name and date.

1.  Go to: [Literary Networks](https://www.teachengineering.org/activities/view/uno_graphtheory_lesson01_activity2)

    -   Instructions are on Teams.

<!-- -->

2.  **Make your data** using the instructions, from Friends or BBT... or LB or HIMYM....

    -   in the nodes CSV, use `Id` and `names` as your columns. Any other details in other columns to the right.

    -   in your `edges` use `from` and `to` are your first columns. Entries in these columns can be `names` or `Id`s but be consistent and don't mix.

3.  Decide on 3 questions that you to create graphs for.

4.  Create graph objects.

5.  Write comments in the code

6.  Write Reflection ( ok, a short one!) *inside* your RMarkdown

7.  Group Submission: RMarkdown with joint authorship.

Ask me for clarifications on what to do *after* you have read the Instructions in your group.
