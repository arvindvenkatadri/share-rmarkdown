This RMarkdown document is derived from *A Layered Grammar of Graphics* by Hadley Wickham, which is on the Files folder. 

I strongly encourage you to glance through the original article, when you work more with this document. 

Esp. IAIDP,VCSB and HCD people. Oh, and FILM people.

## Components of the layered grammar of graphics

### Layer

**Layers** are used to create the objects on a plot. They are defined by five basic parts:

1.  Data ( What dataset/spreadsheet am I using?)
2.  Mapping ( What does each column do in my graph?)
3.  Statistical transformation (stat) (Do I have calculate something first?)
4.  Geometric object (geom) ( What shape, colour, size..do I want?)
5.  Position adjustment (position) ( Where do I want it on the graph?)

#### Tidy Data

![Tidy data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/tidydata_1.jpg)



#### Kids of Variables

**Kinds of Variable** are defined by the kind of questions they answer to:

1.  What/Who/Where? -> Some kind of Name or Category (Remember Lars Gustaffson)
2.  What Kind? How? -> Some kind "Type"
3.  How Many? How large? -> Some kind of Quantity



### Data and mapping

We will use "real world" data. Let's use the `penguins` dataset in the `palmerpenguins` package.[^6]

[^6]: Run `?penguins` in the console to get more information about this dataset.

```{r penguins-1}
head(penguins, n = 3)
```
```{r penguins-2}
tail(penguins)
dim(penguins)
?penguins
```



**Aesthetic Mapping** defines how the variables are applied to the plot. So if we were graphing information from `penguins`, we might map a penguin's flipper_length_mm to the $x$ position and body_mass_g to the $y$ position.
We can map variables metaphorically to other things: shape, colour, size, alpha(how dark?)....

For our running example, 

```{r mapping}
penguins %>%
  select(bill_length_mm,body_mass_g) %>%
  rename(x = bill_length_mm,
         y = body_mass_g)

penguins %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE)
```


## Statistical transformation

A **statistical transformation** (*stat*) transforms the data, generally by summarizing the information. For instance, in a bar graph you might summarize the data by graphing the total number of observations within a set of categories.

A stat is a function that takes in a dataset as the input and returns a dataset as the output; a stat can add new variables to the original dataset, or create an entirely new dataset. So instead of graphing this data in its raw form:

```{r stat_raw}
penguins %>%
  select(island)
```

You would transform it to:

```{r stat_transform}
penguins %>%
  count(island)
```

Sometimes you don't need to make a statistical transformation. For example, in a scatterplot you use the raw values for the $x$ and $y$ variables to map onto the graph. In these situations, the statistical transformation is an *identity* transformation - the stat simply passes in the original dataset and exports the exact same dataset.

## Geometric objects

**Geometric objects** (*geoms*) control the type of plot you create. Geoms are classified by their dimensionality:

-   0 dimensions - point, text
-   1 dimension - path, line
-   2 dimensions - polygon, interval

Each geom can only display certain **aesthetics** or visual attributes of the geom. For example, a point geom has position, color, shape, and size aesthetics.

```{r geom_point_position_colour}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, # x-position => bill_length_mm
                     y = body_mass_g, # y-position => body_mass_g
                     color = island)) + # color => Island as Metaphor
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("A point geom with position and color aesthetics")
```


```{r geom_point_position_colour_shape}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = body_mass_g, 
                     color = species, 
                     shape = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("A point geom with position and color and shape aesthetics")
```

-   Position defines where each point is drawn on the plot
-   Color defines the color of each point. Here the color is determined by the class of the car (observation)

Whereas a bar geom has position, height, width, and fill color.

```{r geom_bar-1}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = species)) + # x position => ?
  # No need to type "mapping"...
  geom_bar() + # Where does the height come from?
  ggtitle("A bar geom with position and height aesthetics")
```

```{r geom_bar-2}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("A bar geom with position and height aesthetics")
```

-   Position determines the starting location (origin) of each bar
-   Height determines how tall to draw the bar. Here the height is based on the number of observations in the dataset for each possible number of cylinders.

## Position adjustment

Sometimes with dense data we need to adjust the position of elements on the plot, otherwise data points might obscure one another. Bar plots frequently **stack** or **dodge** the bars to avoid overlap:

```{r geom_bar_position_stack_and_dodge}
count(x = penguins, species, island) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = n, fill = island)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle(label = "A stacked bar chart")

count(x = penguins, species, island) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = n, fill = island)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle(label = "A dodged bar chart")
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species, fill = island)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle(label = "A stacked bar chart")

penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = species, fill = island)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle(label = "A dodged bar chart")
```

Sometimes scatterplots with few unique $x$ and $y$ values are **jittered** (random noise is added) to reduce overplotting.

```{r position}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = species, 
                     y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("A point geom with obscured data points")

ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = species, 
                     y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  ggtitle("A point geom with jittered data points")
```

## Scale

A **scale** controls how data is mapped to aesthetic attributes, so we need one scale for every aesthetic property employed in a layer. For example, this graph defines a scale for color:

```{r scale-color}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, 
                     y = bill_length_mm, 
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point() 

```

Note that the scale is consistent - every point for a compact car is drawn in tan, whereas SUVs are drawn in pink. The scale can be changed to use a different color palette:

```{r scale-color-palette}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = body_mass_g, 
                     color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

Now we are using a different palette, but the scale is still consistent: all Adelie penguins utilize the same color, whereas Chinstrap use a new color **but each Adelie still uses the same, consistent color**.

## Coordinate system

A **coordinate system** (*coord*) maps the position of objects onto the plane of the plot, and controls how the axes and grid lines are drawn. Plots typically use two coordinates ($x, y$), but could use any number of coordinates. Most plots are drawn using the [**Cartesian coordinate system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system):

```{r coord-cart}
x1 <- c(1, 10)
y1 <- c(1, 5)
p <- qplot(x = x1, y = y1, geom = "point", xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL) +
  theme_bw()
p +
  ggtitle(label = "Cartesian coordinate system")


ggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() + 
  coord_polar()
```

This system requires a fixed and equal spacing between values on the axes. That is, the graph draws the same distance between 1 and 2 as it does between 5 and 6. The graph could be drawn using a [**semi-log coordinate system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-log_plot) which logarithmically compresses the distance on an axis:

```{r coord_semi_log}
p +
  coord_trans(y = "log10") +
  ggtitle(label = "Semi-log coordinate system")
```

Or could even be drawn using [**polar coordinates**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system):

```{r coord_polar}
p +
  coord_polar() +
  ggtitle(label = "Polar coordinate system")
```

## Faceting

**Faceting** can be used to split the data up into subsets of the entire dataset. This is a powerful tool when investigating whether patterns are the same or different across conditions, and allows the subsets to be visualized on the same plot (known as **conditioned** or **trellis** plots). The faceting specification describes which variables should be used to split up the data, and how they should be arranged.

```{r facet-1}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ species)
```

```{r facet-2}
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(species~island)

# Ria's explanation: This code did not work becasue....
```

## Defaults

Rather than explicitly declaring each component of a layered graphic (which will use more code and introduces opportunities for errors), we can establish intelligent defaults for specific geoms and scales. For instance, whenever we want to use a bar geom, we can default to using a stat that counts the number of observations in each group of our variable in the $x$ position.

Consider the following scenario: you wish to generate a scatterplot visualizing the relationship between penguins' bill_length and their body_mass. With no defaults, the code to generate this graph is:

```{r default}
ggplot() +
  layer(
    data = penguins, 
    mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                  y = body_mass_g),
    geom = "point", 
    stat = "identity", 
    position = "identity"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  coord_cartesian()
```

The above code:

-   Creates a new plot object (`ggplot`)

-   Adds a layer (`layer`)

    -   Specifies the data (`penguins`)
    -   Maps engine bill length to the $x$ position and body mass to the $y$ position (`mapping`)
    -   Uses the point geometric transformation (`geom = "point"`)
    -   Implements an identity transformation and position (`stat = "identity"` and `position = "identity"`)

-   Establishes two continuous position scales (`scale_x_continuous` and `scale_y_continuous`)

-   Declares a cartesian coordinate system (`coord_cartesian`)

How can we simplify this using intelligent defaults?

1.  We only need to specify one geom and stat, since each geom has a default stat.

2.  Cartesian coordinate systems are most commonly used, so it should be the default.

3.  Default scales can be added based on the aesthetic and type of variables.

    -   Continuous values are transformed with a linear scaling.
    -   Discrete values are mapped to integers.
    -   Scales for aesthetics such as color, fill, and size can also be intelligently defaulted.

Using these defaults, we can rewrite the above code as:

```{r default2}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = penguins, 
             mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                           y = body_mass_g))
```

This generates the exact same plot, but uses fewer lines of code. Because multiple layers can use the same components (data, mapping, etc.), we can also specify that information in the `ggplot()` function rather than in the `layer()` function:

```{r default3}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```

And as we will learn, function arguments in R use specific ordering, so we can omit the explicit call to `data` and `mapping`:

```{r default4}
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```
